This is an extremely simple script, so nothing except standard python is required.

Its a bit crude, but I'd say simple makes perfect in this case.

I made this in like 10 minutes because I was annoyed I couldn't listen to music from my headphones in bed but not wake up to it in the middle of the night, and since spotify are cunts they never added a sleep timer to the windows version,
so I made my own.

Only works on windows.
